Authentication project from The Odin Project curriculum @ www.theodinproject.com
The goal of the project is to build one's own authentication system. From The Odin Project: it "involves building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it". The project closely follows M.Hartl's tutorial at http://www.railstutorial.org.
