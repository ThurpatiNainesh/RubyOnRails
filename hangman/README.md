This is a simple command line Hangman game created as a part of The Odin Project. 

The game features two options: the first option allows to load in a file with words and select a random word with a length of 5 to 12 characters.
The file '5desk.txt' with a list of words comes from http://scrapmaker.com/.

The maximum number of turns to play is 12. During the game a player may save the game at any turn at a text file. Here's where the second option comes in, as the player may load in a saved game instead of always starting a new one.
